name: Report Generator
description: Use this skill when the user asks to "create a report", "save this as a report", "make a nice report", "export to HTML", "generate an artifact", "build a dashboard", or when a substantial analysis has been completed and the user wants a polished, shareable output. Also trigger when the user says "save this", "export this", "make this pretty", or "I need to share this with my team". Generates branded reports in the SegmentStream dark theme style — as self-contained HTML files (Claude Code) or JSX artifacts (Cowork).

# Report Generator

Create polished reports styled after the segmentstream.ai website. Supports two output formats depending on the environment:

- **Claude Code** → Self-contained HTML file saved to `.artifacts/`, opened in browser
- **Cowork** → JSX artifact rendered inline with React, Tailwind, and Recharts

The design system, content structure, and components are identical across both formats.

## When to Use

Generate an HTML report when:
- A substantial analysis has been completed and the user wants a shareable artifact
- The user explicitly asks for a report, export, or dashboard
- The conversation has produced data tables, insights, and recommendations that deserve a polished format

Do not auto-generate reports without the user asking — this is an explicit output format, not a default.

## Design System

The template at `assets/template.html` implements the segmentstream.ai visual identity:

- **Self-contained**: No external references — no CDN links, no @import URLs, no external fonts or scripts. System fonts only. All SVGs inlined. Reports must work fully offline.
- **Dark theme**: Black background (#000), card backgrounds (#111), subtle borders (white at 8% opacity)
- **Accent**: Indigo (#6366F1) for highlights, tags, and emphasis
- **Typography**: System sans-serif for body text, system monospace for data/tables/labels
- **Components**: KPI cards, data tables with channel icons, callout boxes, tags, inline SVG charts, bar indicators, two-column layouts
- **Channel icons**: Read `references/channel-icons.md` for inline SVG icons of ad platforms. Only ad platforms get icons; organic channels render as plain text.

Read `assets/template.html` to understand the full CSS class vocabulary before generating any report.

## Output Format

Detect the environment and choose the appropriate format:

**Claude Code** (local terminal, has filesystem + `open` command):
- Read `assets/template.html` and `assets/logo.svg`
- Generate a self-contained HTML file (no external references, system fonts, inline SVGs)
- Save to `.artifacts/{name}.html` and open in browser

**Cowork** (no browser, artifacts render inline):
- Read `references/jsx-format.md` for JSX component patterns and Tailwind token mapping
- Generate a single-file React component using Tailwind + Recharts for charts
- Write as a `.jsx` file — Cowork renders it as an artifact automatically

The user can also explicitly request a format: "save as HTML" or "make a JSX artifact."

## Workflow (HTML — Claude Code)

### Step 1 — Read the template and logo

Read `assets/template.html` to load the complete HTML template with all CSS styles and component patterns. Also read `assets/logo.svg` for the SegmentStream logo SVG. Both are essential — the template contains the full design system and the logo provides brand identity.

### Step 2 — Assemble the report

Replace the template placeholders:

- `{{LOGO_SVG}}` — The contents of `assets/logo.svg` (inline SVG, not a file reference)
- `{{REPORT_TITLE}}` — Main headline (e.g., "March 2026 Performance Report")
- `{{REPORT_SUBTITLE}}` — One-line summary (e.g., "Channel performance, maturation analysis, and intent signals for Ribble Cycles")
- `{{REPORT_DATE}}` — Current date in human-readable format (e.g., "16 March 2026")
- `{{REPORT_META}}` — Meta tags as `<span>` elements, use `class="accent"` for emphasis. Example: `<span>Ribble Cycles</span><span>Conversion: <span class="accent">CRM + Online Orders</span></span><span>Attribution: <span class="accent">First Click 90d</span></span>`
- `{{REPORT_BODY}}` — The main content, built from components below

### Step 3 — Build the body from components

Use these HTML patterns to construct `{{REPORT_BODY}}`. Each major section wraps in `<section>`:

**KPI cards** — Use for top-level metrics:
```html
<div class="kpi-grid">
  <div class="kpi-card">
    <div class="kpi-label">Spend</div>
    <div class="kpi-value">£38.8k</div>
    <div class="kpi-change positive">+2% YoY</div>
  </div>
</div>
```
KPI change classes: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`. Only apply the color class to the change value itself — if you include a comparison label (e.g., "vs Jan 2026"), keep it in a separate neutral element so it doesn't inherit the red/green color:
```html
<div class="kpi-change negative">-45%</div>
<div class="kpi-change neutral">vs Jan 2026</div>
```

**KPI grid layout:** Default is 3 columns. Add `kpi-grid-2` or `kpi-grid-4` to the `.kpi-grid` div for 2 or 4 columns. Partial last rows are center-aligned automatically. Avoid layouts that leave a single orphan card — if you have 7 KPIs, use 4-column (4+3) rather than 3-column (3+3+1).

**Data tables** — Use for channel breakdowns, comparisons:
```html
<div class="data-table-wrapper">
  <table class="data-table">
    <thead><tr><th>Channel</th><th class="num">Cost</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody><tr><td>Google Ads</td><td class="num">£24,090</td></tr></tbody>
    <tfoot><tr><td>Total</td><td class="num">£38,800</td></tr></tfoot>
  </table>
</div>
```
Use `class="num"` for right-aligned numeric columns. Use `class="positive"`, `class="negative"`, or `class="accent"` on `<td>` for colored values.

**Inline bars** — Use inside table cells for visual proportions. Only use when there is no separate percentage column already showing the same data — avoid redundancy.
```html
<td class="num">39%<div class="bar-container"><div class="bar-fill" style="width: 39%"></div></div></td>
```

**Callout boxes** — Use for key insights or warnings. Wrap inline numbers (currencies, percentages, ROAS multipliers) in `<span class="num">` and entity names (channels, campaigns, products) in `<strong>` so they stand out from the surrounding text.
```html
<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-title">Key Insight</div>
  <div class="callout-body">At <span class="num">2.1x</span> ROAS and <span class="num">£129</span> CPA, Generic Broad sits 50% below the account average.</div>
</div>
```
Variants: default (cyan), `callout warning`, `callout positive`, `callout negative`.

**Tags** — Use inline for status labels:
```html
<span class="tag positive">+79%</span>
<span class="tag negative">-48%</span>
<span class="tag">First Click</span>
```

**Insight lists** — Use for bullet-point findings and recommendations. Wrap inline numbers in `<span class="num">` so they pop visually:
```html
<ul class="insight-list">
  <li><strong>Shopping is the standout:</strong> <span class="num">50</span> conversions at half the 2025 spend, delivering <span class="num">4.8x</span> ROAS.</li>
</ul>
```

**Timeseries chart** — Use inline SVG for daily/weekly trends (no external libraries). Draw inside a `.chart-wrapper` div with `<svg viewBox="0 0 800 220">`. Use polylines for data series, circles for data points, and text elements for axis labels.

Chart color palette — every line on a chart must be a **distinct color**. Never use the same color for two series, even with different dash patterns:
- `#6366F1` (indigo) — primary metric (e.g., sessions, spend)
- `#10B981` (green) — positive/actual values (e.g., observed conversions)
- `#F59E0B` (amber) — projected/estimated values
- `#EF4444` (red) — negative/declining metrics
- `#888888` (gray, dashed) — comparison/previous period

Grid lines: `rgba(255,255,255,0.04)`. Axis labels: font-size 10, fill `#555`, font-family `var(--font-mono)`. Data point dots: r=3 for primary, r=2 for secondary. Add a legend row above the chart using small colored swatches.

**Two-column layout** — Use for side-by-side content:
```html
<div class="two-col">
  <div><!-- left content --></div>
  <div><!-- right content --></div>
</div>
```

**Drill-down (expandable rows)** — Use CSS grid (not table+flexbox) so parent and child columns align. Wrap in `.data-table-wrapper` for consistent card styling:
```html
<div class="data-table-wrapper">
  <div class="drill-down">
    <div class="drill-head">
      <span>Channel / Campaign</span>
      <span class="num">Cost</span>
      <span class="num">Conv.</span>
      <span class="num">CPA</span>
      <span class="num">ROAS</span>
    </div>
    <details open>
      <summary>
        <span class="drill-name"><span class="chevron"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"><polyline points="4,2 8,6 4,10"/></svg></span> ICON_SVG Channel Name <span class="tag">58% of spend</span></span>
        <span class="num">£18,420</span>
        <span class="num">198</span>
        <span class="num">£93</span>
        <span class="num">4.6x</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="drill-child">
        <span>Campaign Name <span class="tag">Best</span></span>
        <span class="num">£6,200</span>
        <span class="num">82</span>
        <span class="num">£76</span>
        <span class="num">5.2x</span>
      </div>
    </details>
    <div class="drill-total">
      <span>Total</span>
      <span class="num">£31,060</span>
      <span class="num">326</span>
      <span class="num">£95</span>
      <span class="num">4.3x</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Place status tags ("Best", "Review") next to the campaign name in the first column, not after the last metric. Use `<details open>` on the first channel so it's expanded by default.

### Inline number highlighting

Anywhere numbers appear in prose text — callout bodies, insight lists, recommendations, executive summaries — wrap them in `<span class="num">`. This renders them in monospace with the indigo accent color, making data scannable within paragraphs. Applies to currencies (£129), percentages (48%), ROAS multipliers (2.1x), and counts (50 conversions).

Similarly, wrap entity names (campaign names, channel names, product names) in `<strong>` so they stand out from the surrounding descriptive text.

### Channel icons everywhere

Use inline SVG channel icons (from `references/channel-icons.md`) not just in table cells but in any component that shows channel names — bar lists, category bars, drill-down parent rows. Wrap with the `.ch` pattern: `<div class="ch">ICON_SVG <span>Channel Name</span></div>`.

### Step 4 — Write the file

Save to `.artifacts/` with a descriptive kebab-case filename:
```
.artifacts/ribble-march-2026-performance.html
```

Create the `.artifacts/` directory if it does not exist.

### Step 5 — Open in browser

```bash
open .artifacts/ribble-march-2026-performance.html
```

Tell the user the file path and that it's been opened.

## Workflow (JSX — Cowork)

### Step 1 — Read the brand constraints and logo

Read `references/jsx-format.md` for the SegmentStream brand colors, typography rules, chart color palette, and Cowork constraints. Also read `references/logo-component.jsx` and copy the logo component verbatim into your report (do not truncate or simplify the SVG). This is intentionally minimal — it defines the brand identity and lets you design the layout.

### Step 2 — Design and build the component

Create a single `export default function ReportName()` component. Use your design judgment with shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and Recharts. The reference file gives you the color palette and a few hard rules (distinct chart colors, mono for numbers, dark theme). Everything else — layout, spacing, component choice, how to structure the data — use your best instincts. The goal is a polished, professional report that feels like it belongs on segmentstream.ai.

Also read `references/channel-icons.md` for ad platform SVG icons to inline in channel tables.

### Step 3 — Write and confirm

Save as `.artifacts/{name}.jsx`. Tell the user it should render in Cowork's artifact panel.

## Content Guidelines

- **Lead with KPIs** — put the 4-6 most important numbers in a KPI grid at the top
- **Tables are the backbone** — the SegmentStream aesthetic is data-forward; use tables generously for channel breakdowns, comparisons, maturation data
- **Callouts for insights** — pull out the 2-3 key takeaways as callout boxes between tables
- **Keep text tight** — section descriptions should be 1-2 sentences max; let the data speak
- **Use tags for change indicators** — colored tags make YoY changes and status immediately scannable
- **Format numbers cleanly** — use £, %, x for ROAS, k/M for large numbers, consistent decimal places
- **Include a "What This Means" or "Recommendations" section** at the end with an insight list

## Naming Convention

Files should follow: `{client}-{topic}-{period}.{html|jsx}`

Examples:
- `ribble-march-2026-performance.html` (Claude Code)
- `ribble-march-2026-performance.jsx` (Cowork)
- `ribble-channel-maturation-q1-2026.html`

## Error Handling

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| No analysis data in conversation | Ask the user what data to include; do not generate an empty report |
| Template file missing | Reconstruct from memory — the CSS is self-contained and documented above |
| `.artifacts/` doesn't exist | Create it with `mkdir -p .artifacts/` |
| `open` command fails | Provide the file path for manual opening |
